							experience or other
							transactions.</p>
						<h6>COOKIES</h6>

							available your IP
							address, operating system, browser type and the data you access for system administration
							and to improve
							your experience. In common with most websites, our site uses cookies, (small data files
							which are downloaded
							to your computer) so that we can recognise that your computer has visited the site before,
							to improve your
							experience of the site, for example, by allowing the site to remember your bookmarks and
							language
							preference. You can if you wish set your Internet browser so that it will not automatically

							cookies vary from
							browser to browser. They are generally explained in the help section of the browser.</p>
						<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites
							set or access
							cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may
							become
							inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
						<h6>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h6>
						<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we
							reasonably
							consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the
							original purpose.
						</p>
						<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will
							explain the
							legal basis which allows us to do so.
							Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in
							compliance with the
							above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
						<h6>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h6>
						<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set
							out in the
							table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
							<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
							<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our <p>business
									or our assets.
									Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or</p>
								<p>merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may</p>
								<p>use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>


						<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in
							accordance
							with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data
							for their own
							purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in
							accordance with
							our instructions.</p>
						<h6>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h6>
						<p>We may share your personal data within the IHG GROUP LIMITED Group. This may involve
							transferring your
							personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
						<p>Some of our external third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so
							their
							processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of personal data outside the EEA.
						</p>

						<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of
							protection is
							afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide
								an adequate level
								of protection for personal data by the European <p>Commission. For further details, see
									European
									Commission: Adequacy of the</p>
								<p>protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Where we use Group companies and/or certain service providers, we may use <p>specific
									contracts approved
									by the European Commission which give personal</p>
								<p>data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European</p>
								<p>Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>


						<h6>7. DATA SECURITY</h6>
						<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
							accidentally
							lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
							access to your
							personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
							business need to
							know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to
							a duty of
							confidentiality.</p>
						<p>
							We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will
							notify you and any
							applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
						<h6>8. DATA RETENTION</h6>
						<h6>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h6>
						<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
							collected it for,
							including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
						</p>
						<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount,
							nature, and
							sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
							disclosure of your
							personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can
							achieve those
							purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
						<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our
							retention
							policy which you can request from us by contacting us at info@ihggroup.co.uk. In some
							circumstances you can
							ask us to delete your data.</p>
						<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be
							associated with you)
							for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely
							without further
							notice to you.</p>
						<h6>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h6>
						<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your
							personal data
							and those are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
							<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
							<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
							<li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
							<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
							<li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
							<li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
						</ul>



						<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at by email at
							info@ihggroup.co.uk.</p>
						<h6>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h6>
						<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
							rights).
							However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
							excessive.
							Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
						<h6>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h6>
						<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
							ensure your right
							to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
							measure to ensure
							that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may
							also contact you to
							ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
						<h6>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h6>
						<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us
							longer than a
							month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
							case, we will
							notify you and keep you updated.</p>
						<h6>10. GLOSSARY</h6>
						<p><b>Legitimate Interest </b> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our
							business to
							enable us
							to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure
							we consider and
							balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we
							process your
							personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
							where our
							interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise
							required or
							permitted to by law).</p>
						<p><b>Performance of Contract</b> means processing your data where it is necessary for the
							performance of a
							contract
							to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a
							contract.</p>
						<p><b>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</b> means processing your personal data where
							it is
							necessary for
							compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
						<h6>THIRD PARTIES</h6>
						<h6>INTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</h6>
						<p>Other companies in the IHG GROUP LIMITED Group (acting as controllers or</p>
						<p>processors) and who are based within or outside the EEA, in the United States, in South
							Africa and provide
							IT and system administration services.</p>
						<h6>EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</h6>
						<p>Who may be based within or outside the EEA, such as in the United States, in South Africa
							including the
							following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
							<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide
								consultancy,
								banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
							<li>HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities who require reporting of
								processing activities in
								certain circumstances.</li>
						</ul>

						<h6>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h6>
						<p>You have the right to:</p>
						<p><b>Request access </b> to your personal data (“data subject access request”). This enables
							you to receive a
							copy of
							the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
						<p> <b>Request correction</b>
							of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
							inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
							the new data you
							provide to us.</p>
						<p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
							personal data
							where
							there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us
							to delete or
							remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
							processing (see
							below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
							erase your
							personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
							comply with your
							request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
							at the time of
							your request.</p>
						<p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
							interest (or those
							of a
							third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
							object to
							processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
							You also have the
							right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In
							some cases, we
							may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
							override your
							rights and freedoms.</p>
						<p><b>Request restriction of processing </b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
							to suspend the
							processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
						<p>(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</p>
						<p>(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</p>
						<p>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
							establish,
							exercise or defend legal claims; or</p>
						<p>(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
							overriding legitimate
							grounds to use it.</p>
						<p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
							to you, or a
							third
							party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
							format. Note that
							this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us
							to use or where
							we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
						<p><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal
							data. However,
							this
							will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
							consent. If you
							withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We
							will advise you
							if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
